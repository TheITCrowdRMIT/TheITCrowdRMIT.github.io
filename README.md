My interest in IT started when I first wrote a program in Java BlueJ in the ninth grade.It really took me by surprise that the simple code that I wrote could produce vast results.

**IT Experience**- I had a 12th grade project in which my topic was to create a java program for an Airline Ticket booking system which was also backed up by SQL and I did a pretty decent job considering my group mates were no help at all and I should have charged them.



**Sophie  (s3742024)**
- **Personal website**: https://sophiesha.github.io

**Background**- I moved to Australia 8 years ago after I finished my Bachelor degree of management in China. In the new country I became an early childhood educator and I enjoyed my work so much, but unfortunately I had to change my career direction due to my recent unexpected back injury. So I decided to come back to university to study something that has more potential job opportunities in future.

**Hobbies**- I am a self taught artist. I have been learning drawing, watercolor painting for a couple years. In the past year I also started to learn piano through home tutor and YouTube videos.  Recently, I began to design and make my own leather products, so far I already made myself a nice leather purse, a handbag and a backpack and plenty of other leather presents for my family and friends.

**Interest in IT**- I am interested in developing mobile applications with good UI/UX design that can make our everyday life more efficient and convenient. I chose RMIT as my university because I believe that RMIT is a great place to do IT related studies as it has very good reputation in Australian IT industry. During the study at RMIT, I expect to learn heaps of up-to-date IT knowledge and useful programming skills, and eventually become a real IT professional in the industry.

**IT Experience**- Except the basic computer and internet knowledge, I don't really have much experience in IT. I am a fresh beginner in this industry.



**Wenshuo  (s3729628)**
- **Personal website**: https://yukiwang3729628.github.io

**Background**- My Nationality is Chinese and I can speak in two languages, English and Mandarin. I did my foundation program in Eynesbury College, Diploma of Commerce in Griffith College and currently I am pursuing Bachelor of IT at RMIT University.

**Hobbies**- I used to be a professional aerobic gymnast when I was in high school, and I achieved ‘national level athlete’ title in China. Occasionally I would do some volunteer jobs that organised by Australian churches as a dance coach to help with training children.I am really interested in skin care and beauty treatment, so I enrolled in the cert III of Beauty Service as my part time course. I have been studying towards it currently in order to gain more professional skills and improve myself.
								
**Interest in IT**- My parents both are engaged in the IT industry. They had a great influence on me, as they often tell me IT tips and interesting things when they work at home. That is the primary experience of IT for me. The subtle influence of the family environment sparked my interest of IT, and that is the main reason why I chose information technology as my major in university program.    
    
**IT Experience** -  In my high school, I have completed lots of technology related tasks that include making PPT for presentation, publishing advertisements and organizing activities on our student website. I’m familiar with using Microsoft officework, CSS, Wix,Photoshop, WordPress and Adobe Illustrator.



**Denise  (s3719547)**
- **Personal website**: https://denbp.github.io
 
**Background**- I'm an Australian citizen, but I was actually born and raised in the Philippines till I was 9. This is my first year at RMIT and at university in general.
I'm actually quite a huge gamer and it is one of my motivators. I also love writing narratives. I love creating worlds and characters and storylines to see how everything and everyone grows. My imagination runs wild!

**Hobbies**- As someone who’s passionate about video games, of course I’d play them a lot. I also like trying on different styles of makeup and costume-making. I also like photography and video filming.

**Interest in IT**- I’ve always been interested in IT especially video games because I’ve been surrounded with technology from an early childhood and my mother worked at an I.T-based university. My love of both technology and video games got me to try out I.T and programming, and I would love to learn more and have it in my skill set, since I know it will be very useful for my dream job.

**IT Experience**- I’ve played around with HTML plenty of times before, usually for adjusting website layouts.



**Thanh  (s3743935)**
- **Personal website**: https://thanhq1024.github.io

**Background**- I am Vietnamese/Chinese Australian. I was actually born in Saigon, Vietnam, and moved to Australia in the year 2000, so I’ve been living in Australia as a citizen for the past 18 years. This is my first year at RMIT, though I came from doing the Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) at Monash University the previous year, switching from studying psychology to studying IT.

**Hobbies**- My hobbies include playing badminton on weekends, building plastic model kits of ‘Gundam’ mecha-robots, and playing video games whenever I can! (Have to shorten the growing stack of games somehow, right?) 

**Interest in IT**- If there had to be an interest for me in IT, it would have to be software development. I have always been interested in IT, since video games were, and still are a big part of my life. The actual reason that I wanted to go into IT was mainly derived from being in my year 12 software development class. Something about the way that my teacher at the time, Mr. Cooper, taught the class, and realizing how much fun coding was to me. 

**IT Experience**- Apart from taking Software Development as a year 12 unit, other experience I have in IT is next to nothing, having only taken a class in HTML & CSS, and whatever I have learnt so far studying the Bachelor of Information Technology here at RMIT University.

### Ideal Jobs





## Industry Data

The job titles of the group’s ideal jobs are of the following: Web Developer, UX Designer, Systems and Networks Administrator (shortened to Systems Administrator for Burning Glass data), Video Game Designer (generalised to Graphic Designer for Burning Glass data) and Software and Game Developer (shortened to Software Developer for Burning Glass data).

As of March 2018, there is the highest demand for Graphic Designers among these job titles, followed by: Systems Administrators, Web Developers, Software Developers and UX Designers, in that order. This is the same compared to data from February 2018. Although, compared to May 2017, the demands for each job title are vastly different. In order, there is a high demand for Software Developers, followed by: Graphic Designers, UX Designers, Web Developers and Systems Administrator.

This shows that employers are starting to have a bigger need for Systems Administrators, especially compared to last year, while there is not much demand for UX Designers. According to data from March 2018, UX Designers ranked the fifth lowest in terms of demand from employers.


The group’s required general skill set are as follows:
-	Problem-solving skills
-	Time management
-	Leadership
-	Creativity
-	Communication skills
-	Decision-making skills
The group’s required IT-specific skill set are as follows:
-	SQL
-	Javascript
-	Microsoft Windows
-	Graphic Design
-	HTML5
-	CSS3

From data collected from Burning Glass in March 2018, general skills that would be most useful according to employers are the following, in order: Communication skills, Problem-solving skills, Creativity, Leadership, Time management and Decision-making skills having the lowest rank. Other skills that were not listed down but were ranked high in the data were Organisation skills, Writing and Team work/Collaboration. Both pieces of data are exactly the same as data collected the month prior, on February 2018. Compared to data collected in May 2017, though, Time management is now less valued compared to the year prior, and Decision-making skills was not really valued at all.

With IT-specific skills, March 2018 data shows that in order, the most useful skills in demand are: SQL, Javascript, Microsoft Windows and Graphic Design. Although, HTML5 and CSS3 weren’t in demand at all. It was slightly different in February 2018, with Graphic Design and CSS3 nowhere to be found and there being a slight demand for experience in HTML5. In May 2017, Graphic Design was not found in the data either.


Looking at this data, as someone whose dream job is to be a video game designer, my opinion has changed a little. Graphic design being low or not on there in the skills desired has made me realise that I do not necessarily need to be a genius at graphic design to land my dream job, although I still need to know what’s necessary. But, it is a relief to know that to get to where I want to be, I can take my time to further refine the skills that I will eventually need in order to be a video game designer. 



## IT Work

**Interview an IT Professional**

**What kind of work is done by the IT professional?**

Bing is an IT project manager who works in a place called “Big Data”. He said this is a profession in which rights and responsibilities coexist. In his daily work, he conducts background investigations on the project, collect and collate relevant materials, conduct demand planning, write project investigation reports and information summaries, conduct complete system design for project components or modules, contact project related units and relevant technical experts, formulate project feasibility, and collaboratively cooperate to formulate and declare the project report materials.


**What kind of people does the IT professional interact with?**

He usually works with other IT professionals, technical experts and client sites if it’s necessary. The project manager must effectively control all aspects of project development, assist and guide the work of project team members, identify and deal with problems in the project in a timely manner, and make a reasonable evaluation of the work of the project team members.  In addition, he has to maintain good communication with client site to ensure that everyone's efforts are on the right way. 


**Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?**

IT project manager is the first responsible person for the entire project. So he spend most of time on the following parts.
 
1. Managing and controlling the quality and progress of the entire project. Analyzing deviations and taking corrective actions.
2. Organizing the requirements analysis work and organizing the review of the requirements document and the requirements change document.
3. Distributing system design task for his project team members.
4. Organizing project development team meetings and preparing meeting minutes. Analyzing and solving difficult and suspect problems to ensure full communication between members of the group.


**What aspect of their position is most challenging?**

Bing said that being an IT project manager, you are not only required to have the relevant knowledge of  IT products and computer science, you also need to have practical work experience in IT industry technology development and project management, have good language skills, communication skills, coordination skills, organizing and management skills, etc. 

As a manager, he said the most challenging part is that he must have a macro perspective of the whole project rather than focus on only one part. For example, how to allocate resources such as personnel in the group as needed and establish internal management and communication mechanisms of the project team according to project specifications are. Another challenging thing for him is that clients always change their minds very frequently.
