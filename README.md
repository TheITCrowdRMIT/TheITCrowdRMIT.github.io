### Personal Information

**Aditya  (s3733790)**
- **Personal website**: <https://aditya-dutta.github.io>

**Background**- I was born and brought up in India. I actually used to live in the most liveable city in India called Pune which is a huge part of my life. I used to go to school at “The Bishop’s CO-ED School” which was regarded as the best school in the city and then for Junior College, I went to “The Lexicon International School” where I have spent some of the best days of my life.

**Hobbies**- I love Tennis, I am a huge Rafael Nadal fan. I am pretty good at the sport along with many other sports as well like Football, Cricket and Table Tennis along with great passion for Pool and Monopoly.

**Interest in IT**- My interest in IT is too learn and understand how things work. We are all living in a tech-savvy world and so it's really important to understand and know what is happening everyday rather than just living blindly all the time.
My interest in IT started when I first wrote a program in Java BlueJ in the ninth grade. It really took me by surprise that the simple code that I wrote could produce vast results.

**IT Experience**- I had a 12th grade project in which my topic was to create a java program for an Airline Ticket booking system which was also backed up by SQL and I did a pretty decent job considering my group mates were no help at all and I should have charged them.



**Sophie  (s3742024)**
- **Personal website**: <https://sophiesha.github.io>

**Background**- I moved to Australia 8 years ago after I finished my Bachelor degree of management in China. In the new country I became an early childhood educator and I enjoyed my work so much, but unfortunately I had to change my career direction due to my recent unexpected back injury. So I decided to come back to university to study something that has more potential job opportunities in future.

**Hobbies**- I am a self taught artist. I have been learning drawing, watercolor painting for a couple years. In the past year I also started to learn piano through home tutor and YouTube videos.  Recently, I began to design and make my own leather products, so far I already made myself a nice leather purse, a handbag and a backpack and plenty of other leather presents for my family and friends.

**Interest in IT**- I am interested in developing mobile applications with good UI/UX design that can make our everyday life more efficient and convenient. I chose RMIT as my university because I believe that RMIT is a great place to do IT related studies as it has very good reputation in Australian IT industry. During the study at RMIT, I expect to learn heaps of up-to-date IT knowledge and useful programming skills, and eventually become a real IT professional in the industry.

**IT Experience**- Except the basic computer and internet knowledge, I don't really have much experience in IT. I am a fresh beginner in this industry.



**Wenshuo  (s3729628)**
- **Personal website**: <https://yukiwang3729628.github.io>

**Background**- My Nationality is Chinese and I can speak in two languages, English and Mandarin. I did my foundation program in Eynesbury College, Diploma of Commerce in Griffith College and currently I am pursuing Bachelor of IT at RMIT University.

**Hobbies**- I used to be a professional aerobic gymnast when I was in high school, and I achieved ‘national level athlete’ title in China. Occasionally I would do some volunteer jobs that organised by Australian churches as a dance coach to help with training children.I am really interested in skin care and beauty treatment, so I enrolled in the cert III of Beauty Service as my part time course. I have been studying towards it currently in order to gain more professional skills and improve myself.
								
**Interest in IT**- My parents both are engaged in the IT industry. They had a great influence on me, as they often tell me IT tips and interesting things when they work at home. That is the primary experience of IT for me. The subtle influence of the family environment sparked my interest of IT, and that is the main reason why I chose information technology as my major in university program.    
    
**IT Experience** -  In my high school, I have completed lots of technology related tasks that include making PPT for presentation, publishing advertisements and organizing activities on our student website. I’m familiar with using Microsoft officework, CSS, Wix,Photoshop, WordPress and Adobe Illustrator.



**Denise  (s3719547)**
- **Personal website**: <https://denbp.github.io>
 
**Background**- I'm an Australian citizen, but I was actually born and raised in the Philippines till I was 9. This is my first year at RMIT and at university in general.
I'm actually quite a huge gamer and it is one of my motivators. I also love writing narratives. I love creating worlds and characters and storylines to see how everything and everyone grows. My imagination runs wild!

**Hobbies**- As someone who’s passionate about video games, of course I’d play them a lot. I also like trying on different styles of makeup and costume-making. I also like photography and video filming.

**Interest in IT**- I’ve always been interested in IT especially video games because I’ve been surrounded with technology from an early childhood and my mother worked at an I.T-based university. My love of both technology and video games got me to try out I.T and programming, and I would love to learn more and have it in my skill set, since I know it will be very useful for my dream job.

**IT Experience**- I’ve played around with HTML plenty of times before, usually for adjusting website layouts.



**Thanh  (s3743935)**
- **Personal website**: <https://thanhq1024.github.io>

**Background**- I am Vietnamese/Chinese Australian. I was actually born in Saigon, Vietnam, and moved to Australia in the year 2000, so I’ve been living in Australia as a citizen for the past 18 years. This is my first year at RMIT, though I came from doing the Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) at Monash University the previous year, I decided to make the switch from studying psychology to studying IT. As IT was something that I am also passionate about learning, hoping to someday, somehow, to combine the 2 disciplines together.

**Hobbies**- My hobbies include playing badminton on weekends, building plastic model kits of ‘Gundam’ mecha-robots, and playing video games whenever I can! (Have to shorten the growing stack of games somehow, right?) 

**Interest in IT**- If there had to be an interest for me in IT, it would have to be software development. I have always been interested in IT, since video games were, and still are a big part of my life. The actual reason that I wanted to go into IT was mainly derived from being in my year 12 software development class. Something about the way that my teacher at the time, Mr. Cooper, taught the class, and realizing how much fun coding was to me. 

**IT Experience**- Apart from taking Software Development as a year 12 unit, other experience I have in IT is next to nothing, having only taken a class in HTML & CSS, and whatever I have learnt so far studying the Bachelor of Information Technology here at RMIT University.

Tips for the learner: Make extensive use of a computer and the Internet. Actively touching the keyboard will keep your mind active. When trying to remember information, close your eyes and "write" the information in the air. Picture the information in your mind as you do so.


**Wenshuo**

**Myers-Briggs test**: 

Defender Personality (ISFJ, -A/-T) Defender personality is quite unique. I have excellent analytical abilities but sensitive, enable to build robust social relationships but still reserved. I am often receptive to change and new ideas and try my best to strive for win-win situations. Doing tasks reliable and patient with great enthusiastic.

**Learning style test**:

Visual Learner Visual learners learn best when information is presented in a written language format or in another visual format such as pictures or diagrams.

**Big Five Personality Test**: 

Practical caretaker This Big Five assessment measures my scores on five major dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes abbreviated as OCEAN). Your score for openness was low, at 46%, I probably think of myself as a practical, down-to-earth person and most comfortable in familiar surroundings. My score for conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism was 46%,48% 69% and 46% respectively. Overall, my core values and motivations is practical caretakers.


**Denise**

**MBTI Result: INFJ**

Being an INFJ tells me that I am very altruistic and quite a rare personality type, plus I do not just have dreams, I will very willingly act upon them, due to my Judging (J) trait. It tells me that I am quite stubborn in what I believe in but seek balance in life and society. I feel that this is quite accurate for me, especially since some sources say that we can tire ourselves out because we think of others first before ourselves very often.

**Learning Style: Visual**

Being a visual learner, I learn best with diagrams and pictures. I absorb things better when I can picture them vividly in my head or if they are visualised right in front of me. I have never been a fan of textbooks in school, and would usually never use them. When writing notes, I almost always draw diagrams or tables so I am able to read them clearer and learn quickly. I am also a huge fan of colour-coding, and use highlighters and different coloured pens often for easier reading. 

**Big Five Personality Results**: 

Low Extraversion, High Neuroticism, High Agreeableness High Conscientiousness and High Openness to Experience


**Thanh**

**Analysis of personality contribution to the group**

**Aditya** is an ISTJ which suggests he is well organized, hard working and almost always completes his work. The Introversion part suggests that he can work in a group but may choose not to mingle with them a lot.

**Sophie** is also an ISTJ which means she is responsible, dependable and hard working. Her Big 5 personality test shows that she has low agreeableness which might not always be the best for team work but till she does her part of the job excellently it shouldn’t be a problem.

**Wenshuo** has a Defender Personality (ISFJ, -A/-T) which is very unique. It shows that she builds robust social relationships and is open minded which is great for the group. Her big 5 personality test also showed Extraversion which is really good socialising trait.

**Denise** has a INFJ personality which is a very rare personality type. It shows that she follows her intuition a lot. She may also get easily demotivated when criticized which isn’t ideal for group work but her big 5 personality test suggests that she has high Agreeableness and high Openness to Experience which is good for team work.

**Thanh** is a INFP-T personality type which means he has great perception of things which is a good asset for a group member. He also has great intuition which combined with his perception makes a really good mix.


### Ideal Jobs
- **Aditya**-**Web Developer**

- **Sophie**-**UI/UX Designer**

- **Wenshuo**-**Systems and Networks Administrator**

- **Denise**-**Video Game Designer or Scenario Writer**

- **Thanh**-**Software and Game Developer**

**Comparison and Contrast ideal jobs**

Both Denise and Thanh want to go into video game designing or development. While Thanh wants to go more into the software part, Denise wants to become either a designer or a scenario writer. Which plays into what Thanh would be doing at the very basic level. Aditya wants to go into web development most probably making websites or user interfaces which goes hand in hand with Sophie’s choice of career which is a UX/UI designer. Both these professions look to make the website or any other functionality more user friendly and more efficient. Wenshuo wants to become a systems and networks administrator which ties most of the web pages together and helps in case of a breakdown. This is very important since even in this age of technology we have network breakdowns and sometimes bug fixes that render the site useless for sometime.



## Industry Data

The job titles of the group’s ideal jobs are of the following: Web Developer, UX Designer, Systems and Networks Administrator (shortened to Systems Administrator for Burning Glass data), Video Game Designer (generalised to Graphic Designer for Burning Glass data) and Software and Game Developer (shortened to Software Developer for Burning Glass data).

As of March 2018, there is the highest demand for Graphic Designers among these job titles, followed by: Systems Administrators, Web Developers, Software Developers and UX Designers, in that order. This is the same compared to data from February 2018. Although, compared to May 2017, the demands for each job title are vastly different. In order, there is a high demand for Software Developers, followed by: Graphic Designers, UX Designers, Web Developers and Systems Administrator.

This shows that employers are starting to have a bigger need for Systems Administrators, especially compared to last year, while there is not much demand for UX Designers. According to data from March 2018, UX Designers ranked the fifth lowest in terms of demand from employers.

The group’s required general skill set are as follows:
-	Problem-solving skills
-	Time management
-	Leadership
-	Creativity
-	Communication skills
-	Decision-making skills
The group’s required IT-specific skill set are as follows:
-	SQL
-	Javascript
-	Microsoft Windows
-	Graphic Design
-	HTML5
-	CSS3

From data collected from Burning Glass in March 2018, general skills that would be most useful according to employers are the following, in order: Communication skills, Problem-solving skills, Creativity, Leadership, Time management and Decision-making skills having the lowest rank. Other skills that were not listed down but were ranked high in the data were Organisation skills, Writing and Team work/Collaboration. Both pieces of data are exactly the same as data collected the month prior, on February 2018. Compared to data collected in May 2017, though, Time management is now less valued compared to the year prior, and Decision-making skills was not really valued at all.

With IT-specific skills, March 2018 data shows that in order, the most useful skills in demand are: SQL, Javascript, Microsoft Windows and Graphic Design. Although, HTML5 and CSS3 weren’t in demand at all. It was slightly different in February 2018, with Graphic Design and CSS3 nowhere to be found and there being a slight demand for experience in HTML5. In May 2017, Graphic Design was not found in the data either.

Looking at this data, as someone whose dream job is to be a video game designer, my opinion has changed a little. Graphic design being low or not on there in the skills desired has made me realise that I do not necessarily need to be a genius at graphic design to land my dream job, although I still need to know what’s necessary. But, it is a relief to know that to get to where I want to be, I can take my time to further refine the skills that I will eventually need in order to be a video game designer. 



## IT Work

**Interview an IT Professional**

**What kind of work is done by the IT professional?**

Bing is an IT project manager who works in a place called “Big Data”. He said this is a profession in which rights and responsibilities coexist. In his daily work, he conducts background investigations on the project, collect and collate relevant materials, conduct demand planning, write project investigation reports and information summaries, conduct complete system design for project components or modules, contact project related units and relevant technical experts, formulate project feasibility, and collaboratively cooperate to formulate and declare the project report materials.

**What kind of people does the IT professional interact with?**

He usually works with other IT professionals, technical experts and client sites if it’s necessary. The project manager must effectively control all aspects of project development, assist and guide the work of project team members, identify and deal with problems in the project in a timely manner, and make a reasonable evaluation of the work of the project team members.  In addition, he has to maintain good communication with client site to ensure that everyone's efforts are on the right way. 

**Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?**

IT project manager is the first responsible person for the entire project. So he spend most of time on the following parts.
 
1. Managing and controlling the quality and progress of the entire project. Analyzing deviations and taking corrective actions.
2. Organizing the requirements analysis work and organizing the review of the requirements document and the requirements change document.
3. Distributing system design task for his project team members.
4. Organizing project development team meetings and preparing meeting minutes. Analyzing and solving difficult and suspect problems to ensure full communication between members of the group.

**What aspect of their position is most challenging?**

Bing said that being an IT project manager, you are not only required to have the relevant knowledge of  IT products and computer science, you also need to have practical work experience in IT industry technology development and project management, have good language skills, communication skills, coordination skills, organizing and management skills, etc. 

As a manager, he said the most challenging part is that he must have a macro perspective of the whole project rather than focus on only one part. For example, how to allocate resources such as personnel in the group as needed and establish internal management and communication mechanisms of the project team according to project specifications are. Another challenging thing for him is that clients always change their minds very frequently.



## IT Technologies 

### Blockchain and Cryptocurrency

**What does it do?** 

**Blockchain-** 

It is a comparatively new method to securely and efficiently create a tamper-proof log of sensitive activity (anything from international money transfers to shareholder records). 

Cryptography are mathematical methods of keeping data  and  identity a secret and so now enters the picture when it comes to recording transactions. Blockchain uses the same cryptographic key technology that keeps hackers from sniffing your credit card number when you type it into an e-commerce website. One digital key ensures only the owner can enter a transaction to the blockchain involving the owners assets, and another digital key lets someone else confirm it really was you who added the transaction.

Blockchain conceptual framework and underlying code is useful for a variety of financial processes because of the potential it has to give companies a secure, digital alternative to banking processes that are extremely time consuming,expensive and use a lot of resources.

Blockchain as a technology has the potential to fundamentally affect a wide variety of processes and technologies. At its core, the Blockchain is a system for eliminating the need for trust in transactions.

Since Blockchain eliminates the risk of cyber crimes it boosts many departments in the Internet of Things like Self-Driving cars that need to be extremely safe before launching in the market.

**Cryptocurrencies-**  

It is a radically new way of paying that makes all the transactions secure and helps to get rid of intermediaries represented by banks, which also contributes to a significant reduction in the commission fee. 

The main feature of cryptocurrencies is that it is made extremely safe by using Blockchain technology — a network of computers having an identical copy of the database and changing its records by a common agreement based on pure mathematics. 

You can also use a really cool feature of the Blockchain technology and that is Smart Contracts that let you make your own cryptocurrencies and tokens.Token is a type of privately issued cryptocurrency, a unit of value that an organization creates to regulate and self-govern its business model, and empower its users to interact with its products while facilitating the distribution and sharing of rewards and benefits to all of its stakeholders.

Given that more and more governments are looking into the regulation of cryptocurrencies, investors are feeling more comfortable about putting their funds into them.

With added regulation, institutional investors will be able to sleep better at night and have to worry less about the uncertainty of the cryptocurrency market. In fact, more investors are seeing cryptocurrencies as a viable asset because of their attractive returns.

Lack of security has long been one of the biggest concerns for traders. In fact, a survey conducted by Encrybit, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, revealed that 40 percent of the participants polled saw security as a major concern.

Despite the measures to ensure stability in the cryptocurrency market, it's still a struggle to stop or at least reduce cryptocurrencies volatility. There are still so many factors keeping them volatile. These include: the currencies lack of intrinsic value, the lack of institutional capital, the implementation of regulations and thin-order books, among other factors.

Although regulation of the currency and their markets will help lower volatility, that alone will not be enough to make a considerable difference in cryptocurrencies volatile nature.

But, as cryptocurrency trading becomes more popular, we should be seeing a decrease in it’s volatility. While it will help people get great gains as the value might shoot up but it could might as well crash.

**What is the likely impact?**

**Blockchain-** 

It will impact us in many ways especially the future where it will become mainstream just like the Internet did. It is going to cause Decentralized Governance-One representation of decentralized governance is depicted by the arrival of Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAO) whose governance and operations run on the blockchain. Arguably, this could be the epitome of business decentralization. 

It will especially affect the middlemen or intermediaries as it will get the work done digitally and in a very straightforward kind of way hence cutting out the intermediary and in turn reducing the cost of the overall transaction or another work of that sort.

It will also have a huge impact on Internet Of Things as it will help make more everyday items digital since blockchain reduces the chances of cybercrime.

**Cryptocurrency-**

The invention of cryptocurrency has had a lot of impact.For starters it has taken the trading world by storm creating many millionaires out of nowhere while also impacting economies like the US Dollar which is the reserve currency of the trading world as cryptocurrency makes everything decentralized on the other hand it is also used by hackers for payments as it is untraceable transactions and hence can cause some huge losses to people.The everyday people will be affected most by it since they might in the future change to cryptocurrencies which is becoming a more common payment method.

While it takes huge amounts of energy to mine these cryptocurrencies which is bad for the environment.Plus we also don’t know how it will impact the economies of the world for the better or for worse since we don’t have much idea in which way cryptocurrencies are headed exactly.

**How will this affect you?**

**Blockchain-** 

It will change the way we make transactions as it will help us cut out the middle men.A wire transfer to a different bank in a different country costs us a lot of money and takes at least 3-5 business days but blockchain will reduce this drastically to maybe 10-30 minutes and also reduce the price.Since I am pursuing my degree in a foreign country it would make money transfers way more reliable and faster.It will make life easier for my parents and grandparents who wouldn’t have to run to the bank every time they want to make a transfer.It will also help originate many other apps that will be useful to us in the future.

**Cryptocurrency-** 

It might in the future become the leading currency of the world and replace the US Dollar.I personally wouldn’t invest in cryptocurrencies and advise my friends and family against it,at least for now since it is really volatile and the prices of a few of them are outrageous.Though it will definitely make transactions safer it has also opened the gates to theft in a way in which cyber criminals ask for ransoms in Cryptocurrencies.Therefore it might be harmful for the less tech savvy people especially
the old people,who might lose their entire life savings in the blink of an eye. Though it may prove otherwise as well and actually helping in people be protected from theft but the inconsistency in it’s rate and its volatility is a problem that makes me opt out of it. 


### Machine Learning

**What does it do?** 

Machine learning as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is getting more and more popular in recent years. It is mainly because the dramatic development of GPU and data storage which allow computer to run a lot faster and be able to store massive amount of data than ever before. Machine Learning has associated with many areas, such as mathematics (algorithms), statistics (data mining), computer science (programming and coding), engineering and some other areas.

So, what is machine learning?

“The field of machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience.” (Tom Mitchell, Machine Learning)
 
According to this simple definition that made by an American computer scientist Tom Mitchell in the preface of his textbook < Machine Learning >, we can get some basic ideas about machine learning. Machine learning involves in computer programs, automatic learning and experience. To extend this definition further by combining with other industry experts’ understandings, we can then tell that machine learning is more like data analytic methods by using various algorithms to enable machine to find patterns in large amount of data then make prediction for future actions. This self-learning process requires minimal explicit rules which have been pre-programmed by human developers.

There are a few most widely adopted machine learning methods, including supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is normally used to predict future events based on historical data in applications. Semi-supervised learning prefers to combine small amount of labeled data with large amount of unlabeled data for training due to cost consideration. Unsupervised learning is well used for recommending items because of the nature of the algorithm is to explore data structures without influence of historical data. The last popular method is reinforcement learning. Its goal is to find the best action with maximal rewards via trial and error in order to optimize speed of the action.

The term ‘Pattern recognition’ was originally from engineering, but nowadays it also has very close relationship with machine learning and artificial intelligence. In another words, pattern recognition plays a very important role in machine learning process. Pattern recognition is trained from labeled data, it extracts and visualizes data patterns that have been identified by the system. In machine learning, there are some main pattern recognition examples, such as classification, regression, sequence labeling and parsing. They use their own ways to assign labels to input values.

Pattern recognition as a main part of machine learning, it has been used as the basis of many new technologies like automatic classification of text, recognition of images of human face, voice and handwriting, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) which supports doctor’s findings, etc. Pattern recognition in real-time helps with solving plenty of real world problems which traditional ways that could not reach. 

In modern societies, new information and technologies have been creating and developing faster and faster, which means machine learning could never be the same as yesterday. It is changing and updating all the time as the models are constantly exposed to new data/information. This constant learning process improves the accuracy and reliability of machine’s decision making.

**What is the likely impact?**

I believe that in a short future almost every industry will be impacted by machine learning significantly. Even nowadays, the applications of machine learning are basically everywhere and quite easy to find.
In order to work more efficiently and winning the game in their own industry most of companies which have involved with great amounts of data have already realized and admitted the value of machine learning. They are now more willing to invest money in machine learning related products to earn good market share.

**Marketing**：Most shopping websites would recommend some items that are quite similar to what you have purchased before, and the websites like YouTube would also recommend some videos that highly chance you would be interested in. These kind of recommendations are all used machine learning to identify your purchasing/ browsing patterns in order to personalize and improve your experiences. This recommendation system also promotes marketing campaign by sending right information to right user.

**Finance**：Financial businesses are more prefer to use machine learning to identify important data to help clients to catch good investment opportunities, and machine learning can also prevent potential fraud to minimize clients’ financial loss.

**Medical care**：In health care industry, the development of wearable / scanning devices that can help doctor or medical experts to quickly collect and make use of relevant data to assess patient's health condition is becoming more popular and important. Machine learning has very critical impact in this industry.

**Cybersecurity**: Due to the explosive increasing of network data, machine learning has to deal with more data related issues and crimes, such as fraud detection, spam emails identification, and identity stealing, etc.    

**Education**：In educational area, machine learning is showing its impact as well. It can change the way of learning and help students to personalize their own study patterns and build up their own unique learning resource kits to ensure their skills and talents can be stimulated to the maximal.


**How will this affect you?**

Today, I would write a few small scenarios to demonstrate how machine learning has affected my everyday life.
 
**Scenario 1**: In a Saturday morning. I checked my Gmail to see what new emails I received previous night while I was having breakfast. I found two new emails sent by “Cotton on” and “Priceline” shops from Promotion folder, then I realized that I signed up memberships in those two shops last week. I never like mix my general emails with those shop emails together but I am too lazy to categorize them by myself. Gmail cleverly did this job for me automatically, it instantly recognized promotion emails and spam emails and sorted them out for me. (Pattern recognition)

**Scenario 2**: At afternoon, outside was quite cloudy I was wondering whether it would rain that night, so I picked up my phone and said “Ok Google” to activate my google assistant by my voice (I have set up my personal google voice ID before by speaking “OK google” to google recording system three times). My mobile screen directly jumped into google assistant chatting screen, then I asked “Is Frankston going to rain tonight?” The assistant displayed Frankston’s weather forecast image on screen and replied me by saying “No, it is not predicted to rain in Frankston tonight, but it will be cloudy.” (Voice recognition)

**Scenario 3**: At night, I turned my TV on and selected “Netflix” application, I found a new Korean TV drama recommendation on top of the main screen called “Life” which the lead actor is one of my favorite Korean actors. I have watched many Korean dramas on Netflix since last year and one of the dramas has almost got the same actor team with this new one. So of course I added the new recommendation to “my list” because I know I would definitely watch it when I’m free. (Pattern recognition) 


### Cybersecurity

**What does it do?** 

Computer network technology is applicated very extensively in various fields, coupled with the improvement of the economic income level of the social masses, which provides an important development prospect for the popularization of computer network technology. However, during computer network technology playing an irreplaceable role in education, economy, politics and military, it also brings some serious issues such as data leakage to obstruct the health development environment.  SearchSecurity indicated that cybersecurity is a subset of security that mainly for protecting against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems in a computing context, including hardware, software and data, from cyberattacks  (Rouse, 2018). Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems and one of the most problematic elements is the constantly evolving nature of security risks. 

Computer network technology has the characteristics of openness and sharing, which makes the computer network extremely easy to use in the process of being attacked by a variety of computer network viruses, to the user's normal experience has brought great negative impact. Usually, in order to reduce the hacker's attack, some collectives and individuals will hide the IP address, strengthen the network security awareness within the enterprise, and adopt real-name authentication to reduce the negative impact of hacker's attack. At the same time, some enterprises will adopt hacker deception technology, reduce the frequency of illegal access, and effectively resist hacker attacks, improve the level of enterprise network management, improve the security and defense capabilities of computer network technology. 

Secondly, to enhance the function of link encryption technology. In the transmission process of encrypted network communication nodes, each transmission information node can correspond to different passwords, and different passwords and encryption information should correspond to each other. It is important to note that the information transmitted by each node must be decrypted accordingly. Secondly, the first and last encryption technology, which is the modern society, computer network technology in the process of information and data transmission, often used in the encryption method. Encrypt the information data entering the network, and then decrypt it after the transmission of information and data technology.

Firewall technology is an important part of computer network security defense technology, which usually relies on a special kind of hardware or software installed by the computer. When the computer network is in operation, firewall technology can use its own rules to gather, the data transmitted in the network to filter rationally, allowing secure data information to be transmitted, limiting the transmission of suspicious data information. Firewall technology is an important guarantee of computer network security defense technology, which is widely used in computer network. In order to strengthen computer hardware technology prevention.Power failure, line interception, alarm system and other computer hardware system failures are easy to affect the security of computer networks. Therefore, to strengthen the daily maintenance of computer hardware, the administrative institutions of computer hardware technology prevention is appropriate to take the initiative (prevention) The active (preventive) mode belongs to the planned maintenance based on months, seasons or years. Professional maintenance personnel are arranged in advance to carry out maintenance activities on computer hardware in administrative institutions. At the same time, in strict accordance with the relevant work requirements of information security level protection, the operator's computer and application software login account number and password are assessed from time to time, and the tracking management is implemented; the security management of important information system data is strengthened, and the data backup is carried out regularly to ensure that the data is no leak, no loss. In addition, in order to strengthen the real-time monitoring of computer networks. Network detection refers to information feedback and information monitoring on the security of network objects. Once there is data transmission in the network, the normal or not of the data can be judged by neural network data analysis, data mining, intrusion detection and other measures, and then the abnormal data flow can be predicted. Illegal data flow. It can adopt corresponding security technology to induce abnormal data flow and illegal data flow to pseudo-servers and pseudo-hosts, so as to avoid computer network security problems to the greatest extent.

**What is the likely impact?**

Hacker's threat to computer network security is very significant. Some computer networks, such as network servers in the military, political and economic fields, have been tampered with by hackers in the way of login and connection without permission, allowing hackers to steal important information from such computers by means of Trojan horse programs. That means it brings great loss to users. Administrative institutions can actively introduce information encryption technology, anti-virus technology, firewall technology, vulnerability scanning technology and other network application technology. In order to enhance the security protection, the network version of virus protection software and the single-machine version of virus protection software can be used at the same time. The single-machine version of virus protection software can be installed on each computer, and the network version of virus protection software can be installed in the workstation, so as to be able to scan data resources remotely and improve virus clearance.

**How will this affect you?**

In 2006, a very malignant computer virus "Panda burning incense" appeared in China, which is downloaded through documents, making infected virus files to computer programs and computer systems caused extremely serious damage. Unfortunately, my computer infected as well, I lost everything on my laptop. "Panda incense burning" virus not only through a website on the user's computer virus infection, but also through the local area network for transmission, in a very short time, thousands of computer programs can be damaged, resulting in computer network paralysis. Computer viruses hide virus codes in some files by some illegal virus programmers, and infect computer programs through web pages, websites, mail, files, etc., which cause serious damage to the computer's use function.

In the process of verifying the identity of network access users, there will be specific security problems under certain circumstances. The authentication algorithm used is not scientific, and passwords are not targeted and difficult to crack. Therefore, the arbitrariness of user authentication should be fully solved, and the security hidden trouble should be effectively eliminated by strengthening password and password management.

on the other hand, Information leakage is becoming more seriously at the moment. For example, when I trying to enter my personal details online to being a member and agreed with private policy, however, lots of junk email and text message are following delivery to my account. 


### Autonomous Vehicles

**What does it do?** 

Autonomous vehicles (otherwise known as driverless vehicles or self-driving vehicles) are a sub-category in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is becoming frequently more popular, and as they become more and more developed, the more they will become readily available to use. It is estimated that, by 2020, the industry will be worth US $87 billion. 

Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that can drive/pilot themselves without human interaction. Allowing cars, boats, and planes to act on their own to get to their designated destinations as we wish. With the implementation of Autonomous vehicles, it would be easier to transport people, and even objects from one place to another. Autonomous vehicles are programmed so that it is capable of sensing its environment before navigating. Combining all sorts of technologies including: 

**GPS (Global Positioning System)**: is a satellite-based, radionavigation system that is owned by the United States government. Using satellite imaging, you would be able to have an overhead view anywhere in the world.

**Odometry**: The use of data from motion sensors to detect the amount of movement over time from a particular position.

**Laser Light**: Technology that measures distance from a target by projecting a laser light at the target and measuring the reflected pulses with a sensor.

With all these technologies in mind, the vehicles would be able to drive around on their own, sensing and detecting on-coming traffic, to be able to navigate itself around the roads without the need of human interaction. 

The concept of Autonomous Vehicles can also be split into 5 core components:

**Computer Vision**: Having the use of cameras in and around the car to be able to see the roads and other cars on the road.

**Sensor Fusion**: Integrating data from other sensors, like radar and lasers (like previously mentioned), along with the use of camera data, to be able to build an understanding of the vehicles environment.

**Localization**: Using GPS and other navigation technology to have the vehicle be able to understand where it is in the world, and of what it looks like.

**Path Planning**: To be able to chart the a course for where we want the vehicle to go within the now discovered space, to have the vehicle be able to maneuver safely and comfortably.

**Control**: Teaching the vehicle to accelerate, brake, or steer at the appropriate times within the world.

With all of this in mind, all kinds of car manufacturers are all trying their best to be able to perfect this technology, since the industry is estimated to be worth billions if done correctly, and shows a lot of promise for its use on the roads.  


**What is the likely impact?** 

The likely impact of implementing autonomous vehicles, is that we’d be able to get to our wanted destination without having to put in the effort of driving ourselves, or waiting for someone else to drive for us. We wouldn’t have to worry about checking our surroundings when driving in lots of traffic, a Even transporting will be made a lot easier, as we don’t need to have a person behind the wheel of said vehicles to deliver packages/cargo to where they need to go. No need for people to travel tens to hundreds of kilometers and be under incredible exhaustion once the delivery is completed. 

Without the interaction with humans, autonomous vehicles, if coded and tested properly, could cause less accidents, since autonomy of the vehicles eliminate all cause of human error from its use. Meaning that instead of having to pay a lot of attention to surroundings as a human driver, the technologies of the car would be able to detect all of it, and finalising a decision based on it. Since this is the case, human reflexes are actually a lot slower when compared to professionally implemented Artificial Intelligence (AI), with the use of the different technologies as mentioned above, can be more precise and accurate.

The use of Autonomous Vehicles would not only be convenient for us to use, but is a lot more safe for us too, and so with the technology closely being perfected, it should not be long before self-driving cars take us wherever we need to go, or deliver goods and items to us. 

**How will this affect you?**

I think that it could greatly benefit someone like me, as I don’t drive a car myself, it would be very convenient to not have to ask someone (that may be busy) to drive me around to where I need to go. Since I use the ride sharing app, ‘Uber’, quite frequently, as a person that likes to keep to himself, sometimes I would just sit there with the driver the entire time and not a word would be said. Even the small talk with the driver is nothing but meaningless and could be cut out completely. So with the implementation of autonomous vehicles, it would be perfect for someone like me as I can get to where I need to go, as quick as the algorithm of the vehicle is programmed to be, with as little human interaction for someone like to me to enjoy. 

Some other things that would also be affected by the implementation of autonomous vehicles is safety. As human error is more or less eliminated with the use of autonomous vehicles, and the amount of accidents between cars would be greatly decreased (depending on much testing and safety features are coded into the vehicle from developers and manufacturers). With such precision and accuracy with the combination of technologies that are built into the vehicles, I could feel safe behind the wheel of a autonomous vehicle as compared to the driving skills of a friend of mine (whom I shall not name for obvious reasons) who nearly had us crash multiple times on a single trip to Mornington Peninsula. 

Generally, when rise of new technologies and gadgets are developed, people tend to steer clear (no pun intended) of them. It also doesn’t help that there have been multiple occurences of accidents caused by autonomous vehicles, but whether or not the blame should be placed on the vehicle itself, or to other factors like human error is a completely different debate. But personally, I’d imagine that the implementation of autonomous vehicles holds nothing but promise for our benefit, as it could be used in many ways. With that said, I look forward to when autonomous vehicles are perfected, making a better world for all of us.





## Project Idea

**Mental Health Assessment Device**

Nowadays, when it comes to mental health assessments, the traditional process could be quite lengthy. Involving having to sit with the mental health professional, answering a plethora of questions to be able to diagnose and determine if the patient has a mental illness. Even though these questions were specifically designed to be able to determine mental health issues, the questions could be subjected to human error, as the patient could be giving ambiguous answers that might make the professional ask a completely different set of questions to determine a totally different mental health issue. With this in mind, we hope to develop a device which can not only be accurate in describing a patient’s mental state, but do it in a very short amount time.

The project that we had in mind borrows ideas and features from each member of the group. Our idea was to create a scanning device, in the form of a set of glasses that the psychologist would wear that can scan the brain and the mental state of the patient, diagnosing whether the person has a mental illness/es in no longer than 5 minutes. The device would be accessing a database that is derived from the DSM-V (stands for the ‘Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), which contains the recorded known mental illnesses that exist and their traits, or use any other medical databases that are available for use. The traditional way of diagnosing a patient, which could take anywhere between 15-45 minutes of assessing via questions given by the psychologist/mental health worker, and answers given by the patient. This proposed device would be able to do all of that in 5 minutes, essentially eliminating the time that it would’ve taken for a patient to be assessed and diagnosed, saving valuable time and money. 

From there, the psychologist/doctor/mental health worker, would be able to identify and treat the patient as they need to.

The device would also come with an accompanying mobile application that can adjust settings for the device. Along with displaying the patient’s mental health data, the device and the app would also be able to display the patient’s physical status such as, the patient’s heart-rate, blood-pressure, etc. From the use of the application, the user is able to record the patient’s diagnosis into a seperate database that can be easily accessed through said application. The application would also be able to send information to a printer to print a hard-copy if need be. 

Though we might not currently possess the technology, nor the skills to be able to develop a device such as this, we feel as though this idea would be very beneficial for use by doctors, psychologist, and mental health workers, being able to go through a lot more patients that may need to be diagnose or treated, in a shorter amount of time. 



## Reflection

### Individual Reflections

**Aditya**

When I heard that we had to do a group project,I was like uuhhh not again but,
I have to say that this might have been the best ever team work I have done in any of my academic studies cause everyone was very professional in the way they went about their work and completed everything on time and their work was also of very good quality.This all to me was very surprising because I have a bad track record of getting very bad groups with people always slacking off and me doing all the work.
This has really changed my perception towards teamwork.I always preferred to work alone given my previous traumatic experiences which had made me realise why Batman prefers to work alone, but now I am pretty happy with how things are going.I have learned that teamwork isn’t bad always on the contrary it can be super beneficial if you have a good team with you so that it can reduce your workload.In all I am happy with how things worked out and I look forward to working with this group again.


**Sophie**

From my perspective, the group did a quite good job in general. After we had first proper meeting in the class and everyone agreed with the group work plan, we all basically sticked with the plan and finished our tasks by group task deadlines. Group communication was a concern during the first week after the group has been formed as the members were not responsive and motivated enough to get the project started, so we had a honest and open discussion in the first group meeting to decide what we needed to do in the following weeks. The group communication has been well improved since then. The one thing that surprised me was we actually finished 70% of the assignment a week ahead of the final due date which means we all showed our respect to the agreed work plan. The one thing that I have learned through the group was, when everyone work towards the same goal a hard project can become a piece of cake. Due to my role as group github repository maintenance person, I have fairly active log of activity with group github account. I told other members that they were only responsible for putting their own assigned tasks into the repository. The group members followed the instructions very well and we built up the website without much struggles.


**Wenshuo**

In my opinion, group formation as an initial step of teamwork is very important. We formed this five people group as we were classmates and we were attracted by Thanh’s project idea.Then we shared our contact details and built a chat group on Messenger in the class to try to organize group things on it timely so we could complete the tasks on time. Sophie developed a timeline and made a work plan for us and shared on Canvas as well. We did had some challenges at the beginning while we were trying to decide everyone’s role in the group, the work progress got a bit delayed because of communication issue. After a serious and effective meeting, we solved problems together and everything went back to right way. Each group member had equally strong contributions to the group project. We completed our tasks efficiently and timely, responded the message positively. Sophie as a leader in our group, she was responsible to check everyone's work progress every weekend. Because I did the “IT Work” part, I interview a IT professional and comprehensively understand what they exactly do their daily work. Furthermore, I build a preliminary perspectives and plans for my future work areas. In general, we did quite good job! This group work did help me to achieve more than when I did alone.



**Denise**

Despite small setbacks we faced upon starting the assignment, everyone did their part well and the group was very well-organised. We were all punctual and had done most of the assignment well ahead of time. This was due to the helpful idea of setting small deadlines for the group to ensure that every part was finished as soon as possible. Group communication was rocky at first, since members were not responsive enough, but it has improved greatly since then. I was not able to attend one tutorial and group meeting due to personal reasons which I was worried about at the time, but I was very pleased to know that everything was organised by then and I was filled in on the details on what happened and what I needed to do. I’m very happy with the fact that we checked on each other and made sure that everyone was pulling their weight, which they did. We all managed to get through the hurdle in the beginning and did our tasks and this assignment overall with great ease, well ahead of the deadline. Overall, this group was very well-organised and everyone did their part well. The members are very reliable and punctual, leading to a very satisfactory result.


**Thanh**

From what I’ve seen from this group, we’ve managed to all pull our weight in regards to the work that each and every one of us had been assigned, and had completed in a timely manner. Though at the beginning it wasn’t so easy as there was very little communication within the group, leading to people being upset. But once the group was able to get together and discuss the assignment and everyone’s roles properly, we were on our way. Aside from this hiccup, we all managed to complete our assigned workloads within the first week, completing well over half the assignment in a matter of days. I can also see that Sophie was checking in every now and again to make sure that people were going to complete their part, and she did a really good job on doing so by messaging the group on what the next plan of action would be. Everyone else has also done superb work for their assigned work, giving as much effort and detail into their work as they should be, giving respect to each other to pull our own weight and not drag the team down, and so as a group, everyone was very responsible and reliable to have as group members. 


### Group Reflection

From group perspective, our overall work process is quite well and smooth.  Sophie as a leader helps the group to work very effectively. She formed a good work plan based on group discussion. We experienced the power of an effective work plan with details and small task deadlines during this assignment completing process, it really helped the group to get organized from the very beginning. We also did weekly work progress check to ensure the workflow was as smooth as possible. 

During the early stage of working together, problem cropped up on member’s enthusiasm for participation, but the issue has been resolved quickly when members realised the importance of effective communication. Though the assignment has been broken up into small tasks and those tasks have been equally distributed to each group members, we still often consulted with one another when we ran into difficulties with our own tasks. We all believe this group work helped us with developing better communication skills and knowledge about what difficulties we may face in future group work and how we overcome them. 
Working in the group did allow us to build some professional knowledge about skills we already have and skills that we need to develop. 

We created a group repository on Github and invited every group member to join so that all the members were able to upload their own tasks on it.
